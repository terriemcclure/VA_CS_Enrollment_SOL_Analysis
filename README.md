## ðŸŽ¯ Research Overview
This project investigates whether participation in **high school Computer Science (CS)** courses correlates with improved **academic outcomes** across both STEM and non-STEM subjects in **Virginia public schools**.

The analysis integrates **Virginia Department of Education (VDOE)** Standards of Learning (SOL) pass-rate data with **U.S. Department of Education Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)** CS enrollment data for school year 2021â€“2022.

---

## ðŸ“Š Research Questions

1. Does access and participation in high school CS classes improve student outcomes inside and outside of STEM?
2. Do schools with higher CS enrollment rates also have higher overall SOL pass rates?
3. Do schools with higher CS enrollment rates have higher **non-STEM** SOL pass rates?
4. Does the relationship between CS enrollment and SOL outcomes differ by **gender** or **race**?

## ðŸ§® Methods

- **Environment:** Python, AWS Glue DataBrew, AWS S3, AWS RDS (MySQL)
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy, StatsModels
- **Data Cleaning:** Filtered school-year data, standardized school codes, merged SOL + CRDC datasets
- **Analysis:**  
  - Correlation between CS enrollment and SOL pass rates  
  - Regression models to test predictors (CS enrollment, gender, race)  
  - Visualization of trends using Seaborn  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Findings

- Schools with higher CS enrollment show **higher overall SOL pass rates**
- Data suggests **broad academic benefits** of CS participation beyond traditional STEM subjects across demographics.
